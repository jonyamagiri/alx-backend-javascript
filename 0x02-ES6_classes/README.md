# 0x02. ES6 classes


> This repository contains the tasks for `ES6 classes` project and a description of what each program or function does:


## Learning Objectives

	* How to define a Class
	* How to add methods to a class
	* Why and how to add a static method to a class
	* How to extend a class from another
	* Metaprogramming and symbols


* In ECMAScript 6 (ES6), you can define a class using the class keyword, which provides a more convenient and object-oriented way of creating reusable code in JavaScript. 
* Metaprogramming is a technique in programming where a program can manipulate or modify its own structure, behavior, or code at runtime. In JavaScript, metaprogramming can be achieved using several features, including Symbols.
