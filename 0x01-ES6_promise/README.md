# 0x01. ES6 Promises

> This repository contains the tasks for `ES6 Promises` project and a description of what each program or function does:


## Learning Objectives

	* Promises (how, why, and what)
	* How to use the `then`, `resolve`, `catch` methods
	* How to use every method of the Promise object
	* Throw / Try
	* The await operator
	* How to use an `async` function


* Promises are objects in JavaScript that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and provide a way to handle the results of asynchronous tasks. A Promise has three states: `pending`, `fulfilled`, and `rejected`. A Promise is `pending` when it is initially created, `fulfilled` when the operation completes successfully, and `rejected` when the operation encounters an error.
* You can create a Promise using the Promise constructor, which takes a single argument: a function called the executor. The executor function takes two arguments: a resolve function and a reject function. The resolve function is used to fulfill the Promise with a value, while the reject function is used to reject the Promise with a reason for failure.
* Once a Promise is fulfilled or rejected, you can use the `.then()` method to attach callbacks that will be called when the Promise is fulfilled, and the `.catch()` method to attach callbacks that will be called when the Promise is rejected. Additionally, you can use other methods such as `.finally()` and `.all()` to handle Promise chaining and multiple Promise handling scenarios.
